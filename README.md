# Global Shark Attacks 
Machine Learning project calculating outcome of shark attacks based on various factors. Gathering information from large datasets containing shark attacks dating back to 300 B.C. Based off the information, the data suggests likelihood of a shark attack based on location, shark type, activity and time period.
